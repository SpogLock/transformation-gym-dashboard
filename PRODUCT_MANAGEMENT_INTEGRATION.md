# Product Management Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the backend Product Management APIs into the frontend dashboard. The system now supports full CRUD operations for products/inventory with real-time data synchronization.

## Files Created

### 1. **src/services/productService.js**
API service layer for product management operations:
- `getProducts(filters)` - Fetch all products with optional filtering
- `getProduct(productId)` - Get single product details
- `createProduct(productData)` - Create new product
- `updateProduct(productId, productData)` - Update existing product
- `deleteProduct(productId)` - Delete product
- `restockProduct(productId, quantity)` - Add stock to product
- `getProductStatistics()` - Get inventory statistics

### 2. **src/contexts/ProductContext.js**
State management with caching for products:
- Centralized product state management
- Caching to prevent redundant API calls
- Automatic cache updates after mutations
- Methods: `fetchAllProducts`, `getProductById`, `addProduct`, `editProduct`, `removeProduct`, `restock`, `fetchStats`

### 3. **src/components/Modals/AddProductModal.js**
Comprehensive modal for creating new products:
- All product fields (name, category, brand, flavor, size, etc.)
- Pricing fields (cost price, selling price)
- Real-time profit calculation
- Stock quantity management
- Supplier information
- Active/inactive toggle
- Form validation

### 4. **src/components/Modals/EditProductModal.js**
Modal for editing existing products:
- Pre-populated with current product data
- Same fields as Add Product Modal
- Real-time profit calculation
- Updates cache after successful edit

## Files Modified

### 1. **src/index.js**
- Added `ProductProvider` to the context hierarchy
- Wraps the entire app to provide product state globally

### 2. **src/views/Dashboard/InventoryManagement/components/InventoryTable.js**
- Integrated with `ProductContext` for real-time data
- Replaced dummy data with API calls
- Added loading states with `AppLoader`
- Connected Add/Edit/Delete modals
- Implemented local filtering and search on cached data
- Maps API product fields to display format

### 3. **src/views/Dashboard/InventoryManagement/components/InventoryTableRow.js**
- Added `onEdit` and `onDelete` prop handlers
- Connected edit/delete actions to context methods

### 4. **src/views/Dashboard/ProductProfile/components/ProductProfile.js**
- Integrated with `ProductContext`
- Fetches product by ID from URL params
- Real-time restock functionality
- Delete product with confirmation
- Edit product via modal
- Loading states with `AppLoader`
- Error handling with toasts

## API Integration Details

### Product Fields Mapping
Backend API → Frontend Display:
- `name` → Product Name
- `category` → Category
- `brand` → Brand
- `stock` → Stock Quantity
- `cost_price` → Cost Price
- `selling_price` → Selling Price
- `supplier` → Supplier
- `image_url` → Product Image
- `description` → Description
- `flavor`, `size`, `protein_per_serving`, `servings`, `type` → Specifications

### Stock Status Logic
- **Low Stock**: stock ≤ 5 units (Red badge)
- **Medium Stock**: 6 ≤ stock ≤ 20 units (Yellow badge)
- **High Stock**: stock > 20 units (Green badge)
- **Out of Stock**: stock ≤ 0 units (Black badge)

### Filtering & Search
Implemented client-side filtering on cached data:
- **Search**: By name, category, or supplier
- **Category Filter**: Filter by product category
- **Stock Status Filter**: Filter by low/medium/high/out stock

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
Following the workspace optimization rules:
1. **Single API call per session** - Products fetched once and cached
2. **Instant navigation** - Cached data used for list/detail views
3. **Local filtering** - All filters applied on cached data (instant results)
4. **Cache updates on mutations** - Create/Update/Delete automatically update cache

### Loading States
- Consistent `AppLoader` component used throughout
- Descriptive loading messages
- Full-height loaders for page-level components

## Usage Examples

### Using Product Context in Components
```javascript
import { useProducts } from 'contexts/ProductContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    products, 
    loading, 
    fetchAllProducts, 
    addProduct, 
    editProduct, 
    removeProduct,
    restock 
  } = useProducts();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchAllProducts();
  }, []);

  // Use products...
}
```

### Creating a Product
```javascript
const newProduct = {
  name: "Whey Protein",
  category: "Supplements",
  brand: "Optimum Nutrition",
  stock: 50,
  cost_price: 3500,
  selling_price: 4500,
  supplier: "Health Supplements Ltd",
  is_active: true
};

await addProduct(newProduct);
```

### Updating a Product
```javascript
await editProduct(productId, {
  stock: 60,
  selling_price: 4800
});
```

### Restocking
```javascript
await restock(productId, 20); // Add 20 units
```
