## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Test user registration with valid data
- [ ] Test user registration with invalid data (validation)
- [ ] Test user login with valid credentials
- [ ] Test user login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Test "Remember Me" functionality
- [ ] Test protected route access (authenticated)
- [ ] Test protected route access (unauthenticated - should redirect)
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test token persistence after page refresh
- [ ] Test user dropdown menu display
- [ ] Test navigation between sign in and sign up pages

### Backend Requirements
- [ ] Ensure Laravel backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Check CORS configuration allows frontend origin
- [ ] Confirm token-based authentication is working

---

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Import AuthContext in any component:**
```javascript
import { useAuth } from 'contexts/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();
  // Use authentication features
}
```

2. **Make authenticated API calls:**
```javascript
import apiFetch from 'services/api';

const getData = async () => {
  const data = await apiFetch('/endpoint', { method: 'GET' });
  return data;
};
```

3. **Check user roles:**
```javascript
import { isAdmin, isStaff } from 'services/authService';

if (isAdmin()) {
  // Show admin features
}
```

### For End Users

1. **Sign Up:**
   - Navigate to `/auth/signup`
   - Enter name, email, and password
   - Optionally check "Remember me"
   - Click "SIGN UP"

2. **Sign In:**
   - Navigate to `/auth/signin`
   - Enter email and password
   - Optionally check "Remember me"
   - Click "SIGN IN"

3. **Logout:**
   - Click on your name in the top navbar
   - Click "Logout"

---

## Configuration

### API Base URL
Located in `src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api';
```

Change this for different environments (development, staging, production).

### Token Storage
Tokens are stored in `localStorage` with the key `auth_token`.

### User Data Storage
User data is stored in `localStorage` with the key `user`.

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Token-based authentication (Bearer tokens)
- ✅ Automatic token inclusion in authenticated requests
- ✅ Client-side form validation
- ✅ Password minimum length requirement (6 characters)
- ✅ Protected routes with authentication checks
- ✅ Logout clears all authentication data

### Recommended for Production
- [ ] Implement HTTPS only (no HTTP)
- [ ] Use httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage for tokens
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- [ ] Add password strength requirements (uppercase, numbers, special chars)
- [ ] Implement session timeout and auto-logout
- [ ] Add email verification for new accounts
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

---

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Required
None! The implementation uses existing dependencies:
- `react` - Already in project
- `react-router-dom` - Already in project
- `@chakra-ui/react` - Already in project

### Existing Dependencies Used
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- React Router (useHistory, Route, Redirect)
- Chakra UI (Form components, Toast, Menu)
